## Introduction
This platform makes family work organization easier than ever. It allows defining tasks, assigning them to family members and discussing tasks. 
At any time, all family members can see progress of all tasks that are visible to them. They can comment on those tasks 
if there is something to discuss. 

In real life, everyday tasks are a common thing (ex. buy bread, walk a dog, etc.). Creating and managing that kind of tasks is very easy using platform. By defining them you don't need to worry they will be forgoten (notifications and alerts can be set for them).

Some real-life tasks generate other tasks (ex. washing clothes generates dry clothes outside). This platform allows to define and use
that kind of tasks.

Tasks can be assigned, or unassigned. Unassigned tasks are placed on an unassigned list and each member can take them or assign them to other members. 

Platform can be used through:
- Android application
- Web application
