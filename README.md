## Introduction
This platform makes family work organization easier than ever. It allows defining tasks, assigning them to family members, discussing tasks
. At every time, all family members can see progress all tasks and their progress (great for parents). They can comment on the task 
if there is something to discuss it. 

In real life, everyday tasks are a common thing (ex. buy bread, walk a dog, etc.). Creating that kind of tasks is very easy in this 
platform and it will make sure they do are not forgot (notifications and alerts can be set for them).

Some real-life tasks generate other tasks (ex. washing clothes generates dry clothes outside). This platform allows to define and use
that kind of tasks.

Tasks can be assigned, or unassigned. Unassigned tasks are placed on an unassigned list and each member can take them or assign them to other
 members. 

Platform can be used through:
- Android client
- Web application
