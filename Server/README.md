# Server

## Introduction
Since, this is a collaborative tool, all data has to be centralised on one place that is reachable to all users for the group.
Therefore, all data and business logic will be done on severside while Client Applications 
([Android application](https://github.com/DujamKrst/HomeBusiness/tree/master/AndroidClient) and [Web application](https://github.com/DujamKrst/HomeBusiness/tree/master/WebClient)) will be used 
for communication to the server.
